The WWE Universe wasn’t sure what to make
of Mankind when he splashed on the scene in
1996. The deranged Superstar dwelled in the
boiler rooms of arenas, shrieked and squealed
throughout matches and randomly pulled
clumps of his own hair out. His legendary
rivalry with Undertaker produced some of
the most brutal matches in WWE history.

When you play for the same franchise that featured John Stockton

and Deron Williams, setting an assist record is a pretty remarkable

feat. In 2023-24, George — at the age of 20 — became the youngest
player to dish double-digit dimes multiple times in a season for

Utah. He handed out 11 helpers in a game twice during November.

You can’t blame him for flashbacks when he

It was the sort of unselfish play that makes
Conner so well-respected by Cardinals teammates
and coaches. Taking the ball at the Falcons’
9-yard line in Week 10 of 2023, he stopped

short instead of scoring — enabling Arizona to
run down the clock, kick a field goal, and deny
Atlanta a comeback chance in a 25-23 win.

AUSAR THOMPSON

Most know that Ausar has a twin (Amen), who
was drafted one spot before him at the 2023
draft. The Detroit rookie also has an older
brother, who helped mold the youngsters into
hoops phenoms. “We started playing two-on-one
and we still couldn't beat Troy, not until we were
like 13 or something,” Ausar told The Athletic.
